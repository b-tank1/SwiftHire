## Business Problem
Given the massive number of job openings, it is a big hassle for job seekers to sift through them effectively to find the desired opening. </br>
Goal of the project is to build a recommender system which automatically suggests the most suitable job openings for a candidate based on their resume.

## Metrics
Click-Through Rate -> % of recommendations clicked by the job seeker, this will be a reflection of users' recognition for the recommendation </br>
Application Rate -> % of recommendations to which the job seekers submitted an application </br>
Cost -> cost of maintaining the infrastructure </br>

## Data
Resume -> uploaded by the user </br>
Job listings -> scraped from web using API connection to an existing Job Board (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc.) </br>
